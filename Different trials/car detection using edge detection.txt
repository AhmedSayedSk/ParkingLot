1. Egde detection for each slot ( using canny).
2. compute the average of white pixels. 
3. if the perecentage of white pixels are more than 40% so that tells that there's a car in this slot.
-Note:
->we may face some problems in this method :
-the car has the same color as the ground this will give as uncertainly precentang.
-if the lightening is not good enough,the precentage of the white pixels wont be accurate.
