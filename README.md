Project description
------
Today’s technology development has speed up our life so that everything around us gets smarter, integrable, faster and sometimes more complex or easier depending on the goal to be achieved.

Nowadays, Image processing and computer vision involved in many real and daily life applications.
One of that applications which we will consider as our project is used to solve a daily issue exits in our life. The where to park in parking areas situation?

Every time you are looking to park your car you need to circle around to find out a free parking spot. That way of search is slow and frustrating. As, sometimes you aren’t the luckiest person ever and after spending time turning all around the parking area you won’t find a free space for parking as the whole parking is full of cars.

Hence, we concern in presenting an application that will be capable of providing you with information about the parking lot you are looking to park your car in. 
  - If there is a free space for you or not?
  - where exactly that free spot in the parking lot to go direct to it saving your effort and time


Project Impact
------
> On individuals 
-	Optimization for driver time, efforts and resources – e.g. car fuel. 
Through finding the suitable parking spot in the nearest parking lot. So, you won't be late on your meeting and appointments anymore
> On community
-	Traffic jam reduction. 
  As, the number of the cars circling around to find free parking spot ‘ll be reduced
> On Environment
-	The other plus side is the environmental impact.
  The less drivers idle, cruise and search for parking, the less the negative impact on the environment. 
  As, the decrement in number of cars turning around will also decrease the amount of vehicle oil burnt and by turn reduces the global ecological footprint.

Note
------
Please keep in mind that the code was compiled at the beginning without the use `Github`
and as a team we finally compiled the code with each and every one of us has his
own mark `(at comments)` on the part he did in the project
