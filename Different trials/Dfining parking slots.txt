1- Rotated Rectangles Algorithm:
1.1-Hough line detection & threshold image
1.2-Contouring
1.3-Find rotated rectangles
1.4-Mask for all area
1.5-Bitwise xor between the mask and the threshold image to get the mask of each slot
1.6-Averaging algorithm on pixels to determine which slot is empty

Problems>> -No accurate rectangles
           -Errors in getting mask

2- Watershed Algorithm
2.1- Hough line detection & Noise filtering
2.2- Double dilate & subtract to get mask for lines
2.3- Use canny & Hough line to remove conncetion between doubled lines
2.4- Finding  contours and applying watershed algorithm

problems>> -No accurate connections removal
           -Failed to apply watershed algorithm
