Project description
------
Today’s technology development has speed up so that everything around us gets smarter, integrable, faster and sometimes more complex or easier depending on the goal to be achieved.
Nowadays, Image processing and computer vision involved in many real and daily life applications.
One of that applications which we will consider as our project is used to solve a daily issue exits in our life. The where to park in parking areas situation?
Every time you are looking to park your car you need to circle around to find out a free parking spot. That way of search is slow and frustrating. As, sometimes you aren’t the luckiest person ever and after spending time turning all around the parking area you won’t find a free space for parking as the whole parking is full of cars.
Hence, we concern in presenting an application that will be capable of providing you with information about the parking area you are looking to park your car in if there is a free space for you or not and where exactly it’s in the parking area to go direct to it saving your effort and time
